# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 5, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  
1. Continued work on Scatterplot Graph Challenge: Added x-axis after battling with Dates in Javascript. Also added the data circle to the chart. More tomorrow.  

**Thoughts**   
Today I (again) wrestled with dates and times in Javascript. In order to calculate the difference in minutes and seconds, I set the other date components to a fixed value.  

**Resources used**  
1. [Mike Bostock on formatting time axis with hours and minutes] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11286872/how-do-i-make-a-custom-axis-formatter-for-hours-minutes-in-d3-js)

### Day 2: January 4, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  
1. Reorganized Git/Github repository using git's filter-branch functionality and submodules  
2. Setup Gulp to automate tasks during production and creating productive distribution  
3. Started with FreeCodCamp's Scatterplot Graph Challenge, changing from D3's version 3 to version 4  

**Thoughts**   
Today I learned that it's possible to filter commits using Git's filter-branch functionality. I was never really happy with not being able to create a hyrarchical structure using Github in an easy way. So today, I decided to put every single project in its own repository resulting in tons of repositories. But also, to use submodules to organize them a little better.  

**Resources used**  
1. [Git's filter-branch functionality] (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch), [Git's submodule functionality] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)  
2. [Udacity's course on Web-Tooling and Automation](https://de.udacity.com/course/web-tooling-automation--ud892)  
3. [What's new in D3 v4] (https://iros.github.io/d3-v4-whats-new)

### Day 1: January 3, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  
1. Reorganized (spaghetti) code of my first D3 diagram into separate files with reusable objects  
2. Setup 100 Days of Code Repository and re-familiarized myself with Wiki-Markup (two spaces for a new line ;-)

**Thoughts**  
I finished my first chart in pure D3. Before, I worked through Udacity's D3 and Data Visualization course and I'm glad to see that the combination of tutorials and practice works out fine for me - in spite of the mission statement of 100 Days of Code. Nevertheless happy to focus on code practice for the next 100 Days of Code and move on with FreeCodeCamp's Certification.
