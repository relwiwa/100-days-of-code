# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  
1. Reorganized (spaghetti) code of my first D3 diagram into separate files with reusable objects  
2. Setup 100 Days of Code Repository and re-familiarized myself with Wiki-Markup (two spaces for a new line ;-)

**Thoughts**
I finished my first chart in pure D3. Before, I worked through Udacity's D3 and Data Visualization course and I'm glad to see that the combination of tutorials and practice works out fine for me - in spite of the mission statement of 100 Days of Code. Nevertheless happy to focus on code practice for the next 100 Days of Code and move on with FreeCodeCamp's Certification.
